## Technical Approach

**Single-File Architecture**: Complete application in one HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

**Event Delegation**: Clean drag-and-drop system using a single event router to handle all interactions without duplicate listeners.

**Local Storage**: Data persisted in browser's localStorage as XML format for easy backup and portability.

**Modern Web Standards**: Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS Grid/Flexbox, and HTML5 Drag & Drop API.
